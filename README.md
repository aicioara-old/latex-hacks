# latex-hacks

While our LaTeX IDE should do these things for us, in practice latex is a 1985 beast and there's no point arguing with the old ones. This repository presents a collection of scripts that allow us to do things that TexStudio (best Linux IDE I found) is still learning.

# Contributing

# Renaming

I am considering renaming this to something like latex-IDE-hacks. For suggestions open Issue or send me an email.
